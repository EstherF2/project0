          <ul>
            <li><p>All of my family members enjoy going to onsen, but we didn't have time to go there in winder.
              Although it was warm, we decided to put onsen our first priority during the trip.</p></li>

            <li><p>In Japan, onsen hotels are really common, while some of these hotels have private onsen in the room,
            which was perfect for my family since some of them didn't really want to be in the public ones.</p></li>

            <li><p>Sometimes, people are banned from taking phones into the onsen place, thus there are limited amount of pictures.</p></li>

            <li><p>Among all the onsen hotels, my personal favorite is Hotel Kaneyamaen. Not only does it have several different onsens,
              but also I can see Fuji Mountain from the room, while the outdoor onsen at the top of the building has the fabulous view of
              Fuji Mountain.</li><p>
